## Usage

This folder contains some benchmark/experiments for evaluation. `archives` stores all the benches that are not reported at the end in my thesis.

## `ext_nova_folding_no_merkle_{mem,time}` and `ext_nova_folding_merkle_forest_{mem,time}`

Due to the prohibitively high number of constraints when using Nova, we employ extrapolation to estimate the memory and time required for folding-based SNARK proofs. Files ending in `_mem` measure estimated memory usage, while those ending in `_time` measure estimated execution time. Both extrapolation scenarios are considered: with and without the Leveled Merkle Forest optimization.

## `lmf_time` and `lmf_mem`

`lmf_time` measures the time required to construct the LMF and compares it against a traditional Merkle tree of the same size. It also measures the average time to generate 10 proofs for randomly selected leaves, along with the average length of these proofs.

`lmf_mem` captures the peak memory usage during the construction phase of the LMF, and similarly compares it with the memory footprint of the traditional Merkle tree.

## `constraints`

`constraints` measures the number of constraints contributed by each component of the folding circuit.

## `folding_no_merkle` and `folding_merkle_forest`

`folding_no_merkle` and `folding_merkle_forest` benchmark the time needed to run the folding steps.

## Archived

### `bls_pairing`

This file benchmarks two ways to verify BLS signature.
- One is by directly comparing the results of two pairings
- The other is by running Miller's loop on both side and performing only one final exponentiation

### `groth16_single_step_native` and `groth16_single_step_emulation`

These file measures the time to generate public parameters and proofs and verify BLS signatures using Groth16.

As field emulation takes a long time, `groth16_single_step_emulation` is created separately to not use `Criterion` (which requires a sample size of at least 10) for benchmarking. Instead, it uses Rust's built-in `Duration` to measure the wall clock running time.

### `bls_r1cs_constraints`

This file measures the number of constraints generated by each component in an R1CS circuit that verifies a BLS signature.

### `nova_folding_no_merkle`

These files benchmark the time required to use a folding-based SNARK (Nova + Groth16) for proving committee rotation.
